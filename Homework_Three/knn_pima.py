'''
Train a k-nearest neighbor classifier to the Pima Indians data. Split the data 50/50 into training and
test sets using train_test_split() with random_state=1 to provide a fixed seed. Try out
different approaches for feature scaling and selection to see their effects on the test set classifica-
tion accuracy. Also experiment with different values for the number of neighbors 𝑘. Report the
highest test set accuracy you are able to obtain. Submit your code in a file named knn_pima.py.
