Fit a logistic regression and SVM to the wine data set. Try out different kernels for the SVM,
tuning hyperparameters, such as the Gaussian kernel width, manually. In the same manner as
Homework 1, first pre-process the data by standardizing each attribute, and then split the data
50/50 into training and test sets using train_test_split() with random_state=1 to provide
a fixed seed. Report the highest test set accuracy you are able to obtain for each classifier. Submit
your code in a file named lr_svm_wine.py.
